Nucleotide sequences used in the study are available in the Alignments directory, or can be retrieved from NCBI with the script "fetch_ACE2_nucl_seqs.sh" using entrez direct utilities (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/).

Sequences were translated, and aligned with MAFFT and manually inspected for variation at known key sites. 

Gene trees were built with the scripts "ACE2_gene_tree_MrBayes.sh" and "ACE2_gene_tree_RAxML.sh."

Figures were made in RStudio using the R markdown file in the directory ACE2_Rcode.

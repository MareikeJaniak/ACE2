### Prepare phylogenetic tree for use with PAML's codeml analyses

Load libraries:
```{r}
library(ape)
```

Read in PAML tree:
```{r}
tr <- read.tree("../PAML/ACE2_PAML_tree.nwk")
```


Check if PAML tree is rooted and unroot if needed:
```{r}
is.rooted(tr)
```

```{r}
tr2 <- unroot(tr)
```

Save unrooted tree to file:
```{r}
write.tree(tr2, "../PAML/ACE2_PAML_tree_unrooted.nwk")
```
